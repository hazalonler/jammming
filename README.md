# Portfolio Project with React.js
# Jammming

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project was build and can be found in the link [https://lively-lokum-45a46d.netlify.app] (https://lively-lokum-45a46d.netlify.app) 
 
## Scope of The Project

Gaining the skill of building a web application using React from scracth was aimed in this project. In the meantime, other different requirements such as interacting with Spotify API, authentication and deployment were practiced while implementing some features like searcing in the Spotify API, creating a playlist to save to the personal Spotify account and making it public for users. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
